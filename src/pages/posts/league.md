In my LGS league, I played against Tyranids.  
It was a tough game because I just couldn’t crack the big monsters.  
Only Ghaz and the Tankbustas could really hurt any of the big bugs, so I got tabled by turn 4.

I think bringing a 20-man squad of Boyz with a Painboy was a good idea for securing some objectives.

The Kommandos with Boss Snikrot were also really valuable—they helped me secure a Terraform objective in the first turn.

I also had a 10-man squad of Grots in the midfield, but the problem was that the Hormagaunts were stronger than my Gretchin. They just ran up the middle and got taken out.

The game ended 40 to 90.
