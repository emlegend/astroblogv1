This weekend, I finished painting my Gloomspite Gitz Stabbas and Squig Hoppers, and I also assembled  and Paintet five Nobz. It was a lot of work painting 37 models, but I think I did a pretty good job!

With my newly arrived Gitmob box, I now have 2,000 points of Gloomspite Gitz and am ready to play my first full-scale game of **Age of Sigmar**.

Meanwhile, adding the Nobz brings my Ork army one step closer to completion.
I realy like my work on my nobz

As for the beginner league at my **LGS**, I lost my first two games but am hoping to secure a win in my third match at the end of February.


see you next week
